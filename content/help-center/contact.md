We provide a multitude of ways of reaching out or [Getting Involved](/articles/contributing/getting-involved/en).

## IRC

[Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is a great way to discuss issues and development with the community, and project developers. It's also a great place for getting support, but remember due 
to timezone differences there might not always be people present to answer your query immediately. You can access IRC using free clients like Hexchat and Quassel! *Note that web IRC clients are not permitted..*

- [#Solus](irc://chat.freenode.net/#Solus) - Support channel.
- [#Solus-Chat](irc://chat.freenode.net/#Solus-Chat) - Off-topic channel.
- [#Solus-Dev](irc://chat.freenode.net/#Solus-Dev) - Development-related discussions.
- [#Solus-LiveStream](irc://chat.freenode.net/#Solus-LiveStream) - Channel used for discussion during Hackfests and other official Solus live streams.
