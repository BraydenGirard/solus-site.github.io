The most recent daily ISO was uploaded last night, and features some small, but noticeable, improvements. 
      
      
- Broadwell support validated       
- SNA (Intel driver acceleration method, the fastest one) now workin fully on Broadwell and Haswell, due to <a href="https://git.solus-project.com/packages/xorg-driver-video-intel/commit/?h=xorg-driver-video-intel-2.99.917-10">syncing</a> with xf86-video-intel git       
- Support <a href="https://git.solus-project.com/packages/kernel/commit/?h=kernel-4.1.1-50">added</a> for NVME block devices (NVM Express, SSD over PCIe)       
- Auditing <a href="https://git.solus-project.com/packages/kernel/commit/?h=kernel-4.1.1-51">disabled</a> in the kernel -- ensuring less console spam and less SSD writes       
- Support <a href="https://git.solus-project.com/packages/kernel/commit/?h=kernel-4.1.1-51">added</a> for additional, common, Realtek WiFi chipsets (RTL8192EE and RTL8723BE)       
- libdrm <a href="https://git.solus-project.com/packages/libdrm/commit/?h=libdrm-2.4.62-6">updated</a> to 2.4.62       
- mesa <a href="https://git.solus-project.com/packages/mesalib/commit/?h=mesalib-10.5.8-11">updated</a> to 10.5.8       

The featured image in this post was taken during hardware validation of Broadwell, and was validated on the Intel NUC (NUC5i7RYH) with Iris 6100 graphics.
