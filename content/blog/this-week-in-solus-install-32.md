Welcome to the 32nd installation of This Week in Solus.

## Solus 1.2.1 Releases Tomorrow

We’re really excited to be releasing our last “traditional” release, Solus 1.2.1, tomorrow. We opted to delay by a day just to ensure we don’t push ourselves too hard after the recent Hackfest, as well as being able to take the time to do additional QA.

## Infrastructure Improvements & Closure of 1.0 Upgrade Path

We have used Bugzilla since mid-2015 and while it has served us well, we are continuously reviewing alternatives and as of Friday, July 22nd, we will be **locking down our BTS**. This will enable us to shift to a better alternative and cherry-pick bug history to migrate over.

This downtime for the Bugzilla will also open the window for additional infrastructure maintenance and **deprecate the upgrade path** from Solus 1.0, which was released over 6 months ago. This means that updating from 1.0 release **will no longer be possible** after Friday and we will be removing the old repository. If you have already upgraded to 1.2, whether it be through the migration tooling during 1.1 or after, **you will not be affected**.

## Impromptu Hackfest & Sundays with Solus

On Saturday, we decided to have an impromptu hackfest to work on items for Solus 1.2.1. If you have the time to watch, we’d recommend it!
