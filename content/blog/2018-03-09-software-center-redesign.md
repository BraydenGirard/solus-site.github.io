## Software Center Redesign

Ikey has been working this week on a redesigned Software Center. We went into this redesign with multiple goals in mind:

1. We wanted to simplify navigation of the Software Center.
2. We wanted to improve discoverability of software, with a new home view featuring "New This Week" and "Recently Update".
3. We wanted to be able to provide a curated featured software list in our repository and open the door to the possibility of doing so on a per component level (such as gaming). This is similar to "editor's picks" in other software centers / "app stores" on other platforms.

In addition to the goals listed above, we've also been having discussions on improving the integration of the Third Party repository. Instead of a dedicated Third Party section, we'll be leveraging the upcoming Software Center's plugin-based architecture, making a Third Party repo plugin and enable Third Party items to be surfaced alongside native repo items throughout the browsing experience, so you could expect to see Google Chrome in the Web Browsers category, Slack and Skype for Linux in Instant Messaging, and so on. Like we'll be doing with snaps in a future release of the Software Center (post Solus 4), we'll visually differentiate Third Party items to communicate to the user where the software is coming from.
