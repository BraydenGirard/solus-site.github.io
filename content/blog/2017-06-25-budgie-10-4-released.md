We're happy to announce the release of Budgie 10.4. Budgie 10.4 introduces a wide-variety of improvements, features,  and fixes for some issues which have persisted across multiple Budgie releases.

## Alt+Tab

In this release of Budgie, the alt+tab switcher will now prefer the theme icon instead of the X11 icon where possible.

## Applets

This release introduces a new applet, Night Light, which can help reduce eye strain by reducing your display's blue light by making your screen "warmer". This applet integrates into the Night Light functionality provided in Mutter 3.24.x and provides quick access to toggling Night Light on/off, as well as:

- Changing the schedule between "Sunset to Sunrise" and "Manual" (which is configured in GNOME Control Center)
- Temperature of the display when enabled
- One-click access to launch your Display settings

The Places Indicator applet also received some love this release, with a new option to always expand the places section when the applet is shown. The whole Places section header is now a clickable button, making toggling the section easier.

Additionally:

- The Calendar widget in Raven will now remove the date selection if you change the month or year.
- The Icon Tasklist applet no longer has a list of "derper" applications for which we'd override the icon. If a `.desktop` file is found, use the icon referenced in it.

## Budgie Menu

Building upon the lessons learned when (*and inspiration from*) implementing the Brisk Menu for MATE, searching has been completely overhauled. We now support the use of categories for searching and provide a predictable, sane search mechanism. Items that previously would not show up as expected, such as searching for "Displays", is now resolved.

For items that would show up a few too many times, we now de-duplicate search results to only showing unique entries when we're in "search mode" or "super compact" mode (in other words, no headers or sidebar categories).

We now dynamically compute scores for a given entry during search in relation to the search term. Assuming the entry is relevant, we'll display results in a given order and allow terms to match and display higher up in the list depending on how close it is to the term, the contents, how much a string is matched, etc.

## Panels

In Budgie 10.4, you can now set vertical panels on the left and right sides of your display. Popovers will correctly indicate (with its "tail") the point of origin, we've done extensive work to ensure all of our animations and applets will display and adjust depending on if they are on (or originating from) a horizontal or vertical panel, and Raven will account for right-side panels and slide out from underneath the panel, as well as anchor to left panels when no horizontal or right panel exists.

With these new panels, you will now also be able to control the panel transparency via a setting in Raven with three modes:

- None: The panel is always opaque.
- Dynamic: The panel is opaque when there is a maximized window on the workspace, or Raven is open, otherwise it's transparent.
- Always: The panel is always transparent.

## Popovers

For Budgie 10.4, we implemented the `Budgie.Popover` widget, enabling us to replace our usage of Gtk.Popover and fix a long-standing issue with inconsistent popover animations, for example Budgie Menu animating across the screen if the user's panel (and the menu applet) was at the bottom.

Furthermore, this Popover widget enables more granular positioning regardless of its origin (top, bottom, left, or right). This granular positioning helped to provide us the opportunity to implement panels for all sides of your display!

## Other Fixes and Improvements

In addition to the above mentioned goodies, some other fixes include:

- The Clock applet will now only redraw when the label contents would change. This resolves unnecessary redraws of the applet.
- daemon: Fixed the order of left-side window buttons, ensuring that the window decoration style is consistent between native and CSD window decorations.
- wm: Ensuring we purge old backgrounds from the cache.
