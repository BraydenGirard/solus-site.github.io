We are happy to announce the first release of Brisk Menu, our implementation of a clean, efficient, and modern menu for the MATE Desktop. Brisk Menu 0.1 enables quick, keyboard-driven 
launching of applications, as well as access to session controls (such as logout, suspend, hibernate) and the system's Control Center.

Brisk Menu is in its early days and we have a lot of plans for it going forward. Firstly, we will be implementing a Favorites feature to enable pinning items inside the menu. Following the implementation 
of Favorites, we'll be enabling customization options for aspects such as (*but not limited to*):

- General Brisk Menu appearance, for example the ability to toggle sidebar icons.
- The Brisk Menu MATE applet label and icon.

You can obtain the tarballs for the release via our [GitHub page](https://github.com/solus-project/brisk-menu/releases) and can expect to see Brisk Menu featured in the upcoming Solus MATE Edition's ISO snapshot!
