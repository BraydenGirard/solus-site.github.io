Bit about ferryd...

We're also thrilled to announce that [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), providers of first-class content delivery, are sponsoring the distribution of packages from our package server via their Managed CDN product, enabling **blazing fast and more reliable** package downloading for Solus users around the world. Fastly is passionate about [open source](https://www.fastly.com/open-source/), with a long history of sponsoring open source projects, including Debian, Inkscape, the Linux Kernel, Mumble, and more.

When we reached out regarding our desire to vertically and horizontally scale out our infrastructure, they brought their expertise and resources to the table, recognizing the opportunity to positively impact the Solus experience for our users all around the world.

Thanks to ferryd and Fastly's support for faster infrastructure, we're able to not only build and upgrade Solus at an accelerated rate, we're able to deliver those upgrades and improvements to you.
