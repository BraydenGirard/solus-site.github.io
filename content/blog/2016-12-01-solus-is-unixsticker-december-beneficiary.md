Every time you purchase merchandise from [Unixstickers](https://unixstickers.com), including [merchandise for Solus](http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/software_stickers/solus-linux-shaped-sticker), 
a portion of the proceeds goes to the respective project.

Each month, Unixstickers chooses a different project to which they donate an **additional portion** of their total revenue towards and we're grateful that Unixstickers has **chosen Solus** to be December's beneficiary. 
Whenever you support Solus, whether by purchasing Solus goodies or [donating directly](https://solus-project.com/support), we apply that money towards maintaining a small network of servers, obtaining and 
replacing hardware, general hardware-related utilities such as connectivity, as well as domains and SSL certificates.
