Description: |
    Starting at the age of 3 as a gamer on the Commodore 64, Peter now has no time for games. He started dabbling with linux back in 1998. After reading all 
    about Solus after the 1.1 release he immediately prepped some packages and jumped across. What was most interesting was the ability to create change and 
    improvements without all the red tape. He now spends his days on Phabricator while eating sandwiches.
