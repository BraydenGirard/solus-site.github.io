Description: |
    Having been a Linux user since the last millennium or so, Rune got started with Solus MATE on an old Core 2 Duo and from then it sort of grew to the point where he now 
    maintains the Solus Samba and Kodi packages. In his spare time he enjoys hanging out with his cats, cycling, working out, long board cruising, tinkering with and fixing up 
    old hardware, cars, motorbikes and mopeds and read up on Mechanical Engineering theory, Computer Science/Programming and all things technology related. He loves dark 
    chocolate, can cook up a mean Italian meat sauce and probably ought to drink more Tea.
