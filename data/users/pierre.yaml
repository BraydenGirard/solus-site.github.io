Description: |
    When Pierre-Yves got his new computer, he decided to give the freshly released Solus MATE 2017.01.01.0 a try for a few days, but it magically operated and he never stopped using it.
    He quickly got involved in Solus, although he had no other experience other than being a casual Linux user, thanks to the accessibility, help, and kindness of the Core Team. He really 
    enjoys helping Solus and its community.
