Description: |
    Joey's first real experience with Linux was when CyanogenMod dropped support for his crappy Sony smartphone and thus he decided to revitalize support for it, 
    teaming up with other amateur developers to once again provide unofficial up-to-date builds for similar devices. Solus initially attracted him as it provided 
    unmatched performance for his low-powered chromebook, with some of the applications not being in the Solus repo he decided to learn the packaging progress 
    and gradually increased his contributions until he was asked to become a Global Maintainer. In real life, Joey has finished university and is deciding what he wants 
    to do with his life; enjoying cycling all around South Wales (when it’s not raining) for it’s natural beauty.
