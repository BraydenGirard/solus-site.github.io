Description: |
    Had a short intermezzo with Linux (Ubuntu 8.04) in his young age but figured out he was not ready for it. The years passed and he got interested again in using a Linux install (because of Windows 10). He tried some different Linux distros but was not happy with them until he tried Solus 3, he fell in love with the OS and the community and got involved with packaging.
